# Data downloading

The data is downloaded from the kaggle website by the [direct link](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mohdph/saudi-arabia-real-estate-dataset). In order to work with the data you should download it and place it in the `data/raw` directory.

After that you can run the following command to extract the data:

```bash
bash prepare.sh
```

Now you can run notebooks in the `notebooks` directory to start working with the data.
